# NYC Jobs

This project collects job descriptions posted to NYC Jobs on Open Data (beginning 2024-12-06). With this data, we hope to understand how traditional machine learning models for natural language processing and classification compare with generative AI. Some experiments:

1. How well can traditional machine learning models classify job descriptions into categories (specified by the data owners in the `job_category` field)?
2. How well does an untuned GPT model classify job descriptions? How much information needs to be provided for this task to be completed at scale?
3. What can we teach other city employees about the difference in resources (employee skills, labor, compute tools, cost) between leveraging machine learning methods and LLMs?
